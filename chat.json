Used OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 for safe token transfers.\n3. Implemented a reward calculation mechanism based on staking duration and amount.\n4. Added events for staking, withdrawing, and claiming rewards.\n5. Included owner-only functions to set staking token, reward token, and reward rate.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract uses placeholder addresses for staking and reward tokens. These should be set to the correct addresses after deployment using the setter functions.\n2. The reward rate is set to 0.001 tokens per second by default. This can be adjusted using the setRewardRate function.\n3. The contract assumes that the staking token has 18 decimals. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the STAKING_TOKEN_DECIMALS constant.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract.\n2. Call setStakingToken and setRewardToken with the correct token addresses.\n3. Optionally, adjust the reward rate using setRewardRate.\n4. Users can then stake tokens, withdraw their stakes, and claim rewards using the respective functions.\n\nRemember to approve the StakingContract to spend the staking tokens on behalf of the user before calling the stake function.\n",
